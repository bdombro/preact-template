# Preact Template

The tiny 16kb preact app that could.

- Started with the official Vite React Typescript template
- Swaps React for Preact under the hood via resolve.alias, so small bundle size and totally inter-compatible
- linting and formatting c/o eslint + prettier
- path alias for ~ --> ./src
- Playwright testing
- Storybook previewing
- uses @slimr libraries for slim niceties
- uses polyfills for less importing
- Global Html Tag components that are loaded with chakra-like css props, zx, \_hover,\_active, css and style shorthands
